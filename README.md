# Emotion_Based_Music_Recommendation_System

## Abstract </br>
The project is to develop an Emotion-based music recommendation system that will require the userâ€™s camera access so the application can click the picture of the user. And find the Emotion of the user, based on the facial expression found by the application in the backend and will suggest the list of the songs on the bases of that emotion. That list will appear on the screen with the default initial song.
